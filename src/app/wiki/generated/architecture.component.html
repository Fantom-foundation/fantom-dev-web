<h2 id="consensus-and-blockchain">Consensus and Blockchain</h2>
<p>At the core of Lachesis is an algorithm insuring that all participants process the 
same transactions in the same order. We have chosen to implement a system 
suitable for the most adversarial conditions - with powerful attackers. This is 
known as Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and has been a field of research for 
over 30 years. Our system is based on our interpretation of a paper published by
Leemon Baird in 2016 <code>&lt;http://www.swirlds.com/downloads/SWIRLDS-TR-2016-01.pdf&gt;</code>__<br>which describes a method for extracting a consensus order of events from a 
data structure representing the history of gossip between a set of participants.
Instead of only gossiping transactions and exchanging votes directly, members 
gossip about gossip itself; something that can be represented in a Directed 
Acyclic Graph (DAG) - the poset. The algorithm for extracting a consensus 
order from the poset is proven to work and attains the theoretical limits of
Byzantine fault-tolerance in terms of the number and power of the malicious
members it can cope with. The messaging routines required to gossip and create 
the poset are very simple compared to other BFT algorithms. The poset 
itself, however, is not ideal for representing the ordered list of transactions 
because it is a two-dimensional object which doesn&#39;t explicitly express a linear 
order of the items it contains. Hence, we developed a method to map the 
poset onto a blockchain. </p>
<p>A blockchain is a data structure where transactions are packaged in hash-linked 
blocks. Each block is identified by a cryptographic hash and contains a hash of 
the previous block, so that blocks can form a chain from the first block ever to 
the last formed block. In this way, all the block - and transactions - are 
connected via a linear linked list structure. In our system, blocks contain a 
collection of signatures of their own hash from the participants. A block with 
valid signatures from at least one third of validators can be considered valid 
because - by hypothesis - at least one of those signatures is from an honest 
member. </p>
<p>Projecting the poset onto a blockchain makes it much easier for third 
parties to verify the consensus order. It makes it possible to build 
light-clients and to integrate Poset based systems with other blockchains.

<h2 id="proxy">Proxy</h2>
<p>Lachesis communicates with the App through an <code>AppProxy</code> interface, which has two
implementations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>SocketProxy</code>: A SocketProxy connects to an App via TCP sockets. It enables 
the application to run in a separate process or machine, and to 
be written in any programming language.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>InmemProxy</code>: An InmemProxy uses native callback handlers to integrate 
Lachesis as a regular Go dependency. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>AppProxy</code> interface exposes three methods for Lachesis to call the App:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>CommitBlock(Block) ([]byte, error)</code>: Commits a block to the application and 
returns the resulting state hash.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>GetSnapshot(int) ([]byte, error)</code>: Gets the application snapshot 
corresponding to a particular block index.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Restore([]byte) error</code>: Restores the App state from a snapshot.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Reciprocally, <code>AppProxy</code> relays transactions from the App to Lachesis via a 
native Go channel - <code>SubmitCh</code> - which ties into the application differently 
depending on the type of proxy (Socket or Inmem).</p>
<p>Lachesis asynchronously processes transactions and eventually feeds them back to 
the App, in consensus order and bundled into blocks, with a <strong>CommitBlock</strong> 
call. Transactions are just raw bytes and Lachesis does not need to know what they 
represent. Therefore, encoding and decoding transactions is done by the App.</p>
<p>See the :ref:<code>api</code> section for more details about the Proxy API.</p>
<h2 id="transport">Transport</h2>
<p>Lachesis nodes communicate with other Lachesis nodes in a fully connected Peer To 
Peer network. Nodes gossip by repeatedly choosing another node at random and 
telling eachother what they know about the poset. The gossip protocol is 
extremely simple and serves the dual purpose of gossiping about transactions and 
about the gossip itself (the poset). The poset contains enough 
information to compute a consensus ordering of transactions. </p>
<p>The communication mechanism is a custom RPC protocol over TCP connections. It<br>implements a Pull-Push gossip system. At the moment, there are two types of RPC<br>commands: <strong>Sync</strong> and <strong>EagerSync</strong>. When node <strong>A</strong> wants to sync with node 
<strong>B</strong>, it sends a <strong>SyncRequest</strong> to <strong>B</strong> containing a description of what it 
knows about the poset. <strong>B</strong> computes what it knows that <strong>A</strong> doesn&#39;t know 
and returns a <strong>SyncResponse</strong> with the corresponding events in topological 
order. Upon receiving the <strong>SyncResponse</strong>, <strong>A</strong> updates its poset 
accordingly and calculates the consensus order. Then, <strong>A</strong> sends an 
<strong>EagerSyncRequest</strong> to <strong>B</strong> with the Events that it knows and <strong>B</strong> doesn&#39;t. 
Upon receiving the <strong>EagerSyncRequest</strong>, <strong>B</strong> updates its poset and runs 
the consensus methods.</p>
<p>The list of peers must be predefined and known to all peers. At the moment, it 
is not possible to dynamically modify the list of peers while the network is 
running but this is not a limitation of the Poset algorithm, just an 
implementation prioritization.</p>
<h2 id="core">Core</h2>
<p>The core of Lachesis is the component that maintains and computes the poset.<br>The consensus algorithm, invented by Leemon Baird, is best described in the 
<code>white-paper &lt;http://www.swirlds.com/downloads/SWIRLDS-TR-2016-01.pdf&gt;</code>__<br>and its <code>accompanying document 
&lt;http://www.swirlds.com/downloads/SWIRLDS-TR-2016-02.pdf&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The poset itself is a data structure that contains all the information about<br>the history of the gossip and thereby grows and grows in size as gossip spreads.<br>There are various strategies to keep the size of the poset limited. In our<br>implementation, the <strong>Poset</strong> object has a dependency on a <strong>Store</strong> object<br>which contains the actual data and is abstracted behind an interface.</p>
<p>There are currently two implementations of the <strong>Store</strong> interface. The 
<code>InmemStore</code> uses a set of in-memory LRU caches which can be extended to 
persist stale items to disk and the size of the LRU caches is configurable. The 
<code>BadgerStore</code> is a wrapper around this cache that also persists objects to a 
key-value store on disk. The database produced by the <code>BadgerStore</code> can be 
reused to bootstrap a node back to a specific state.</p>
<h2 id="service">Service</h2>
<p>The Service exposes an HTTP API to query information about the state of the node
as well as the underlying poset and blockchain. At the moment, it services 
two queries:</p>
<p><strong>[GET] /stats</strong>:  </p>
<p>Returns a map with information about the Lachesis node. </p>
